# ZSim-CXL Simulator
This work-in-progress open-source project extends the native ZSim simulator to support CXL-based memory functionalities. The planned implementation includes CXLBridge and CXL-Switch components. Furthermore, the project will openly share its design concepts and methodologies, while **welcoming bug reports and constructive feedback on its limitations**.

* The design documentation will be located in the `/design` directory
* The source code will reside in the `/src` directory. 

Subsequent updates will be synchronized periodically.
